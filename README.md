# contributing a tile

This is mostly going in order of https://web.archive.org/web/20150114223349/http://www.alexa.com/topsites, so look at the commit history and add whatever site comes next after the most recently added one in the above list. (see http://jsfiddle.net/43q7yn9t/) for an image template). Images must be an official logo for the site (no user-generated logos, images with other art, etc.), must be 400 pixels high and 600 pixels wide, and must be in png format. Please name the tile  using the format domain.tld.png. For example, the tile for example.com would be example.com.png.
